### CAN translator and analyser to allow comunicating between unknown ECUs and CAN ready peripherals in motorcycles (or cars)

---

This code is made to work specifically between AIM Taipan ECUs for a 2023 KTM SX-F 250 and a Bosch screen

Only in testing phase and requires a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 B or higher.

Also requires an Isolated 2 Channel CAN receiver-sender (I use one from waveshare).

All code is done in C but python examples are available in waveshare's website.
