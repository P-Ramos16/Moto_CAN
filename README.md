# Moto_CAN

CAN translator and analyser to allow comunicating between cheap unknown ECUs and CAN ready peripherals in motorcycles (or cars)

---

Only in testing phase and requires a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 B or higher.
All code is being translated from python to C.
Also requires an Isolated 2 Channel CAN receiver-sender (I use one from waveshare).
